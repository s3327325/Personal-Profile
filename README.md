A little bit about myself, admittedly I am more of a dog person than a cat, and strangely I enjoy rainy days rather than sunny days which also ties in with my preference over cold rather than hot. I love watching movies especially comedy, some titles that I enjoy currently are; Brooklynn Nine-Nine, Community, and currently any marvel releases such as Avengers. Aside from movies I also do a bit of gaming, recent titles that I have been enjoying are; Undertale, Dead by Daylight, and Starcraft 2.

<h2 align="center">Interest in IT</h2>

<p align="center"><b>
What is your interest in IT? When did your interest in IT start? Was there a particular event or person that sparked your interest? Outline your IT experience (if any).
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
I am honestly unable to merely pinpoint a single or few selected topics that I find interesting, IT, in general, brings out my curiosity. In the past, I would often get bursts of interest into the world of IT from something as simple as making a shortcut to automatically shut down my computer after a certain amount of time, or something that could execute specific commands within another program while I was nowhere near the computer. What specifically solidified my interest was more of a revelation which came to me roughly five months ago and gave me the realization that I was interested in IT. From this new found interest I was also introduced to a micro-server which my friend was building, instantly I wanted to learn how to make one for myself and currently am. Aside from building hardware I also have some interest in programming language which started with HTML and now branches towards Java from this bachelor degree. 
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
Why did you choose to come to RMIT?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
RMIT has had somewhat of a history through my family. My brother and some of my cousins graduated from RMIT and being the youngest in the family I naturally followed in their footsteps enrolling into RMIT. Before entering into Bachelor of Information Technology I previously did my foundation studies with RMIT, and I enjoyed the time spent in foundation. Also, the final reason why I choose to study IT in RMIT is that the course offered would give a better outcome compared to other universities. I found from my peers that graduates from RMIT had better hands-on experience with both software and hardware compared to other graduates from other universities which relied heavily on theory.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
What do you expect to learn during your studies?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
Since I am somewhat new to the world of IT, entering Bachelor of Information Technology, I would expect to learn a lot. The main topics that I would expect to gain the most would be in general hardware and software development. Regarding hardware, I would expect to learn mainly towards what different pieces of equipment contribute towards; a computer, server, or in general any mechanical device. As for software, it would be how to program using various coding languages such as Java, HTML, Python, or C++. Alongside languages, I also expect to learn different types of software which would aid me in my studies and future endeavors.

<p align="center"><b>
A description (in your own words) of the position, and particularly what makes this position appealing to you.
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
The job for which I wish to strive for is a Java Developer. The first main reason why I would like to pursue this career is due to my current interest in programming. However, this interest does not limit myself just to Java, I would still like to learn different types of programming languages such as; </p>

<ul>
<li> C++ </li>
<li> Python </li>
<li> HTML5 </li>
</ul>

<p align="justify">
The main reason behind the interest to learn different types of programming language stems from my curiosity on how programs were made, and I would like to take part in the development of different types of programs or softwareâ€™s ranging from a simple website to a program that could help develop prosthetic machinery or augmentation for humankind. The second reason why is the idea of teamwork. I wish to work within a team, contribute and accomplish different tasks.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position.
</b></p>

<p>
To pursue the life of a programmer would require multiple skills and experience. The job in which I have chosen to strive for, a Java Developer, requires a minimum of 5 years experience in the field. Aside from experience, there is quite a long list of skills required for the job, such as; </p>

<ul>
<li> Java / Javascript
- A programming language used for different software or applications</li>
<li> JEE
- Also known as Java Enterprise Edition, J2EE</li>
<li> EJB
- Also known as Enterprise Java Beans</li>
<li> Spring
- A framework application for the Java Platform</li>
<li> Servlets
- A Java programming language</li>
<li> JSP
- Also known as Java Server Pages, ties with HTML, XML, and is similar to PHP and ASP</li>
<li> Hibernate
- A framework mapping tool for the Java Language</li>
<li> SQL
- A programming language used to manage large amounts of data</li>
<li> HTML5
- A programming language used to present information on the World Wide Web</li>
<li> CSS
- Also known as Cascading Style Sheets, a programming language used similarly like HTML</li>
<li> XSL
- Also known as Expressing Style Sheets, used to display XML documents</li>
<li> XML Schemas
- Also known as XSD, language used for XML documents and data</li>

</ul>

<p align="justify">
Aside from the list of skills, I am also required to have experience in specific topics or situations such as; building structured codes, both developing and debugging different types of software systems, and working within an Agile methodology (Software Development Methodology). Personality wise I am also required to have the mentality of a team player, which also comes with a keen will to continually improve and learn from senior members of the team.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
A description (in your own words) of the skills, qualifications, and experience you currently have.
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
Personality wise I feel quite passionate about working in a team, and the ability to learn something new is exciting. However, I lack regarding skill or experience since I am entirely new in the world of Information Technology. In the past, my experience only extends towards HTML that roughly ranges from 1-2 monthsâ€™ worth of experience, and I used it to make straightforward personal websites for experimentation and learning purposes. Apart from that, I have learned a general understanding of hardware which I use currently to attempt building a micro-server and a few selected softwareâ€™s which was used throughout middle-high school.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
A plan describing how you will obtain the skills, qualifications, and experience required for the position, building on those you have now. This need not be greatly detailed, (and will probably change significantly over time anyway) but try to be as specific as you can.
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
I understand that the goal to reach the position of a Java Developer would take years to obtain, however, my plan currently is set in stages or goals. The first goal is to finish Bachelor of Information Technology to gain a better understanding of various typesâ€™ of hardware and software. Completion of Bachelor of IT would grant me roughly 3 years of experience. After which I plan to follow up into either an internship program or pursue a postgraduate degree such as Masters of Information Technology or Masters of Computer Science, both which I plan to take within RMIT as well. If I choose to take up a masterâ€™s degree, it will give me roughly 1.5 to 2 years of experience in the field. If I choose to take up an internship program, it will vary between jobs toward development in software. Taking up an internship program can add a few months towards my experience.  On a more personal goal, I plan on learning Python while studying in my Bachelor degree, and further improving my skills with HTML.

Myers briggs test
</i></b></p>

<a href="URL"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/MzLrHxk.jpg" style="float: none; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" ></a>

<p align="center"><b>
What do the results of these tests mean for you?
</b></p>

<a href="URL"><img src="https://storage.googleapis.com/neris/public/images/system/home/home-16personalities.svg" style="float: left; width: 35%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" ></a>

<p align="justify">
Personally, these results seem to define who I am with precision, from the test I am classed as â€˜The Consulâ€™ (ESFJ-A) and my traits lean upon more towards; an extraverted mind, observant energy, a feeling nature, judging tactics, and assertive identity.
</p>

<p align="justify">
Under the section of â€˜Mindâ€™ the trait to be extraverted refers to someone who is confident and can express oneself easily. Personally, whenever I am given a new situation, for example, meeting someone new, I would be shy to express myself openly and would prefer to stay quiet, very rarely will I find myself talking much towards someone new unless I would feel some comfort already beforehand. However, after some time my personality would change, and I would be more open towards that person. This applies to any new situation that is confronted towards me, and my preference would always be to learn and observe at first to ensure I understand the flow of things, after learning and gaining some comfort I would be more open to share and interact with the situation.
Someone who is observant in the class â€˜Energyâ€™ is usually more perceptive towards their surroundings and would live in current times rather than the fantasy of the future. On a day to day basis, I would often find myself focused on the plan or task I have set a day or so before. I rely mainly on facts and logic towards any form of progression, and I would always try to ensure a backup plan was ready just in case any mishaps were to happen. Although this trait is mainly for people who enjoy living within the present time, I do however enjoy content based around fiction, and it could vary from movies or books.
</p>

<p align="justify">
People who side with a feeling â€˜Natureâ€™ rather than thinking are more emotionally open and in general less competitive. As an example, after I have spent some time with someone new, it would be easier for me to express myself openly in comparison to the first encounter. I value teamwork much more than individuality, and I prefer a workspace where everyone is comfortable and can openly express themselves with each other. The fourth trait within the personality test is â€˜Tacticsâ€™. People who lean more towards judging are known to follow life by the book, they plan in advance and are thorough with situations. I agree wholeheartedly with this trait since I take no pleasure with the idea of spontaneous events. I have however lived to cope with random changes in any plan. However, if I were given a choice, I would side with a structured plan. Alongside the plan I would also prefer to have more options rather than sticking to one route, this is to ensure that there will always be something to fall back to safety rather than having things crumble completely. The last trait is â€˜Identityâ€™ individuals who are more assertive in life tend to be stress-free and prefer to take things at a steady pace. In the past whenever I experience stress in any form, it would be quite hard for me to proceed with any task. Thankfully this has gotten better over time as I have learned how to cope with stress easier, just by planning ahead, or literally taking a breather would help reduce my levels of stress.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
As shown from the personality test, I believe my behavior when interacting with a team or group would be quite enjoyable and result in positive outcomes. Personally, I value teamwork and comradery rather than individualism. I would always try to ensure that everyone contributes towards the project or activity and that the members of the team can express both their emotions and ideas openly with each other. 
</p>

<p align="justify">
Initially, I believe that I would be shy and quite timid. These are of course just the initial stages of the group, after getting to know each other and spending some time together, whether it be in group meetings or just outside of work, I would find comfort and be more open towards my peers. Concerning work, I would prefer a scheduled system which can be broken down towards goals or stages.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
I know for a fact that I am not fond of teams that procrastinate and leave work until it is near the deadline, due to the fact that it will develop unnecessary stress and fatigue. Apart from that, I believe that I would look for similar characteristics when forming a team. The best teammate I would hope for is someone who can also handle spontaneous events easily since I personally somewhat lacking in that regard.  When forming a team I would also prefer teammates who are enthusiastic to get the job done, and that would also have a sense of equality so that the workload can be distributed fairly and equally amongst other members.

<p align="justify">
A visual learner strives on watching and observing. On average, 70-80% of the information which is conveyed through speaking or demonstration would be understood and remembered by individuals of this class. As someone who is learning, a student, there are various methods to study for the best results such as; repetition, highlighting important points, taking or rewriting notes, the use of flash cards, or other forms of media such as videos, posters, and presentations. The environment also plays a role, primarily noise. Visual learners do not work well in a crowded environment, and loud noises such as the bustling city life would interfere significantly. A more preferred environment would be a quiet space, one that also does not involve many people. Light music can also be played in the background to aid in studying.

An auditory learner must-hear information for it to be understood. On average roughly 70% of what is heard would be easily remembered for someone of this class. There are a few methods for studying which would show the best results such as; the use of flashcards, reading information out loud, transforming lecture notes into tapes which can be used to listen on repeat, and small discussion groups on average roughly 2-4 people. On a negative note auditory learners are easily distracted by noises, and are unable to work in complete silence for an extended period of time.
</p>

<a href="URL"><img src="https://i.imgur.com/vzHOhIb.jpg" style="float: none; width: 100%; margin-right: 1%; margin-bottom: 0.5em;" ></a>

<p align="justify">
Tactile or Kinesthetic learners have excellent motor skills and require hands-on experience to learn or understand something quickly. Members of this class strive in practical or tutorial classes and take a liking towards making or creating new projects. There are a few ways to aid in future studies such as walking around while reading or talking about the topic will help memorize information easier. Other methods involve comfort and time, a tactile or kinesthetic learner often fidgets while they study which can be a little distracting if not appropriately controlled. Suggestions for fidgeting vary from bringing a simple ball or doing some hand exercises. Aside from fidgeting they are also known to snack while they study. Regarding comfort, music might show significant results, and position is key, the individual must be comfortable while they study which vary from person to person; some prefer lying down on their back or stomach, or simply to sit on a very comfy bean bag. Another method involves the environment, time and technique. Environment wise color plays a role, the more colors that are present in which you favor, the better you can focus on your task at hand. In terms of time, on average studying and taking breaks are to be divided on a 4-1 or 5-1 ratio, for example, 20-25 minutes of studying, 5 minutes break. A simple technique to help with memorization is to close your eyes and picture the information in your head while writing it in the air, as you write the information try to recite it.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
I believe that the first main factor would be the size of the team. As stated by both my Myers Briggs test and Learning style test, I work well in smaller groups of roughly 2-4 people. The larger the group I work with, the longer it will take for me to settle in and contribute as a team member. Another issue I would have to deal with is noise, my learning style indicates that I work best when noise is at a minimum. With a group chatter is unavoidable, this could make it harder for me to get tasks done. In general, I believe I would work both individually and as a group, I would work on my tasks alone and present the results after in group meetings instead of working on the task with multiple members of the team watching over me. Personality wise, I welcome the idea of working within a team, however, my dislike of messy teams who are unorganized or procrastinate will lead me to leave the team. 
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
When forming a team, I would prefer team members who are both enthusiastic and willing to work together. However, even if I favor a quiet environment, I would favor team members that can communicate with each other effectively and without any pressure. Size also plays a significant factor as well, and I would limit the size of the team to roughly an average of 5 heads. With the personality of team members, I would prefer those who somewhat have a similar mindset as I do to avoid any different methods or work style.

<p align="justify">
The big five personality test measures in 5 different categories; Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism, or O.C.E.A.N in short. On the category of openness, I scored a 58 out of 100 which I somewhat agreed upon due to the fact that I enjoy spending time within my own thoughts or imagination and I dislike traditional conventional means. I believe it is important to factor method as a major key component compared to result. What I found odd is that individuals who have a higher than average score of openness are often much more adventurous, this characteristic does not resemble me in any way or form. As for conscientiousness I scored 71 out of 100. As mentioned people who score high in this category have a strong sense of responsibility towards any goal. Although I personally do not see myself as someone who is disciplined, I am however someone who carefully plans their days ahead, and at times months or rarely years. For extraversion I scored a 25 out of 100. People who score low in this category tend to be quieter, and much more timid. I wholeheartedly agree with the score I received. Personally, I find it hard to talk to someone new, only rarely will I open up to someone else. However, I have been told that I am a great listener, which I suppose stems from my quiet nature. People who obtained a low score in this category also was mentioned to have a low sense of excitement, which I find false. Although I have a fear of riding a roller coaster, a simple sequel to a movie franchise I enjoy would definitely get me extremely hyped. For Agreeableness I received a score of 77 out of 100. Once again I agree with this score due to my preference of cooperation over competition. Although I am unable to evaluate myself on how well I fare with my peers, I do find joy if I am able to help my friends. The last category is neuroticism which describes an individual who is prone to negative emotions. I received a score of 58 out of 100. Iâ€™m unsure of how to feel about this score, due to the fact that I would try to always look on the brighter side of things, and in general avoid stress as much as possible. However, I believe that itâ€™s common to feel negativity and I find it natural.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
One of the primary aspects that I believe would influence both myself and the team I am in would be â€˜Agreeablenessâ€™, which would lead me to help team members achieve their target goal. I believe this is a fantastic quality to have, however, my timid nature might often hinder my ability to help others. One of the worries that I would have within a team is whether everyone can cope to work within a schedule or plan, since past experiences have always lead to plans being changed endlessly.  Another issue I would have within a team lies with method or how a team should work on a situation. Due to my average score on â€˜Opennessâ€™ I would most likely stick with a method that worked in the past. Sticking to different methods to work towards a solution might create conflicting arguments between other members and myself.
</p>

<p align="center"><b>
How should you take this into account when forming a team?
</b></p>

<p align="justify">
I believe that conflict is to be expected when working within a team, it all matters down towards how it is resolved. Therefore when picking out team members, or forming a team, I wouldnâ€™t mind taking members who are the polar opposite of what I am. I believe a team who are 100% single-minded would not achieve as well as a team that could cover the otherâ€™s cons. However, after forming a team, I would prefer to have a few sessions together in order to understand each other and be generally more comfortable around one another.

Virtual Gaming

The project in which I would like to develop is a game that is set in stages. Each game released would implement new motivational ideas that tie with Virtual Reality (VR). For example, the first release would be no different to other games on platforms such as the PS4, XBOX, or PC. However, the next release would implement VR, primarily the headset, and ultimately an entire bodysuit. There are two main reasons why I chose to pursue such a project, primarily due to the fact that the game I would like to develop originates from my childhood joys. The game shares similar qualities towards two of my favorite titles; Megaman and Castlevania. The second reason is my interest in Virtual Reality. Personally, I found the idea of the Oculus Rift amazing and it caught my interest. The ultimate goal of this project is to blend both virtual and reality so well that the player would feel as if they are truly the main character. There are already different methods you could improve on the simple VR headset, two involves buying either a machine similar to a treadmill, KAT Walk VR or Omni Directional Treadmill or a bodysuit, Tesla ($1,499).

One of the main traits that is shared between both titles; Megaman and Castlevania, is that they are categorized as side-scrolling games. This means that the characters move within two dimensions, only the Y-axis (Vertical) and X-axis (Horizontal). I would like to improve on it and create a three-dimensional world. The usual view of a side-scrolling game would be of the â€˜sideâ€™ which includes; a good portion of the area, the protagonist, and whatever is around. The changes I would like to make is to swap it for a first-person view (FPS), which I believe would tie in with VR very well. This would mean that the view is within the eyes of the character itself. As mentioned the first initial release or stage would be similar to any other games, this would mean that to play the game you would need a controller such as a keyboard and a mouse. The second stage would tie with a VR headset of choice, and instead of having the player move the mouse around to look around, the user can simply turn his or her head. The third stage would implement both hands and legs, instead of using standard controllers the user will be required to have VR gloves and one of the VR treadmills. The fourth stage of the game would require the user to buy a bodysuit to play. The final stage of the game would allow users to interact with other users in the online world, simply changing Single-player into Multi-player.

<p align="justify">
For stage one the tools and skills required are both to have a good understanding of a gaming development application such as; Unity or Unreal Engine, and to both programming languages; C++ and C#. For design purposes, there are free applications such as Blender which helps with creating 3D models. And last is basic comprehension on how a game is developed, starting with modeling, creating texture maps, rigging models, animating, applying shaders, actual gameplay, then adding user interfaces and sounds.

<p align="justify">
A few difficulties I believe the project would encounter is in both price and connection for the last stage of the game, converting from single-player to multi-player. Concerning price, I believe it can cause difficulties for people who are not financially independent yet, especially when the current cost of a single body-suit can range up to an average of 1500 â€“ 2000$. The second issue that involves price would be the space required to play a game. Some VR machines can be as big as a treadmill, while others require a large open area, such as an entire room for sensors to be placed on each corner of the wall to detect movement. This might become difficult for people to dedicate an area or room for gaming alone, especially when the average age of the consumer would roughly be in the early 20â€™s. The last difficulty would be the speed of the internet. Multi-player games, in general, have had both good and bad reviews, especially in third world locations that have yet to developed fiber optics. This could be solved by installing servers in multiple locations to provide better connections for the users, however, that would divide the general population into groups for example; US, EU, AU, or Asian servers. While it is true that people who live in the US and are connected to US servers would have a better connection rather connecting to a server in EU, however having such division would mean that only people of the same server can play with each other.
